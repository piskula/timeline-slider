notice and other proprietary markings on any derivative work and to include
in the documentation of such work the acknowledgement: "This software includes
KYPO software developed by the Institute of computer science, Masaryk
University, Czech Republic." Any distribution of the Software or any

to take all reasonable steps to insure that the Software is protected and
secured from unauthorized disclosure, use, or release and will treat it with

license. MU shall have the right to terminate this license immediately
by written notice upon Licensee’s breach of, or non-compliance with, any terms
of the license. Licensee may be held legally responsible for any copyright
infringement that is caused or encouraged by its failure to abide by the terms
of this license. Upon termination, Licensee agrees to destroy all copies of the
Software in its possession and to verify such destruction in writing.

commercialize product sold or licensed by or on behalf of Licensee, or (3) use

of the Software, the Licensee agrees to use the software in compliance with Czech
act no. 130/2002 Coll., on promotion of research, experimental development and
innovation.
10. KYPO software is being distributed as a research and teaching tool and
as such, MU encourages contributions from users of the code that might, at MUs’
sole discretion, be used or incorporated to make the basic operating framework
of the Software a more stable, flexible, and/or useful product. Licensees who
contribute their code to become an internal portion of the Software agree that
such code may be used or distributed by MU for any purpose. Licensee may be
also required to sign a separate license agreement before MU can accept it.
